# Description

Keys(Letters) fall down the screen and must be pressed by the corresponding key when they cross the target line.

# Who is this for?

Anyone who wants an interactive and fun way to learn muscle memory with their keyboard and key locations.

# Inspiration

Guitar Hero is obviously a huge inspiration. This is a project aimed at improving my game development and typing skills. Even if only 1 other person finds this game useful/helpful/fun, then this game is a great success in my book.
