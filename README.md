## 📝 Description

Keys(Letters) fall down the screen and must be pressed by the corresponding key when they cross the target line.
Letters will fall on the left side of the screen with keys intended for your left hand, and same for the right side and right hand.

I am creating all of the songs/sfx myself and developing the game in C++ with SFML.

## Who is this for?

Anyone who wants an interactive and fun way to learn muscle memory with their keyboard and key locations.

## 💡 Inspiration

Guitar Hero is my main inspiration for the style of the game. However, I sometimes get bored with the same old typing practice websites so I decided to make my own way to practice. This project is aimed at improving my game development and typing skills. Even if only 1 other person finds this game useful/helpful/fun, then this game is a great success in my book.
